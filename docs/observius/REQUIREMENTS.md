## Problem domain:

```
Suppose you want to catalog the contents of a subnet.

1. What devices do you have?

1. How do you know that:
    Device A with IP 127.0.0.1 detected on 2024-12-01
    --is the same as (or different from)--
    Device B with IP 127.0.0.1 detected on 2025-01-01

1. What tools are effective as Discovery Engines?
    1. Netbox?
    1. OpenNMS?
    1. AI Opportunities?
```

## Key Principles

```
1. Regular Reconciliation
1. Multimodal fingerprinting
    1. Combination creating the unique identifier
        blue_-six___-rochester-north_______
        color-number-city_____-cardinality_
        ip___-mac___-serial___-manufacturer-dns
    1. Collapse?

1. Network Monitoring system
    1. If netcool went away? What would replace it?
    1. Is it possible to get to a point where your NMS is merely orthogonal to the system?
        1. Imagine a network monitoring environment in which you could rip and replace the Network monitoring system with very little pain.
        1. What would that be like? How would you implement it?
        1. What books can you read to learn more about this?
```


## Example of Combining Identifiers (from ChatGPT)

```python
def generate_unique_identifier(mac, serial_number, manufacturer):
    return f"{manufacturer}-{serial_number}-{mac}"

# Example usage
physical_address = '00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E'
serial_number = 'SN123456'
manufacturer = 'Cisco'
unique_id = generate_unique_identifier(physical_address, serial_number, manufacturer)
print(f'Unique Identifier: {unique_id}')
```

## Identification Strategies

```
1. MAC Addresses

    1. Re: Local lookups of manufacturers

        1. WireShark

            1. Wireshark OUI Lookup tool: https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html

            1. There's a link to a database to download from there.

                1. https://www.wireshark.org/download/automated/data/manuf.gz

            1. Consider that link from an automation perspective.

            ```bash
            # This file was generated by TShark 4.5.0rc0-1317-g88850887 with the
            # command `tshark -G manuf`. Its canonical location is
            #
            # https://www.wireshark.org/download/automated/data/manuf.gz
            #
            # The first column contains the MAC address block (24, 28 or 36 bits wide,
            # per IEEE allocation sizes), the second column contains the shortened name
            # used by Wireshark for address name resolution and the third column contains the
            # full vendor name from the registry.
            #
            ```

        1. IEEE

            1. https://regauth.standards.ieee.org/standards-ra-web/pub/view.html#registries

    1. Be mindful of your querying of MAC addresses from a security perspective.

    2. Companies buy individual and ranges of MACs.

1. DHCP logs

    1. If your network uses DHCP, the DHCP server logs can be a valuable source of information for tracking 
    IP address assignments over time. This can help correlate devices that might change IP addresses.

1. SNMP

    1. You can get much more than just the MAC address from an SNMP query

    1. Consider alarms for 'public' and 'private' strings.

    1. Consider pulling all devices with default string 'guesses'

    1. OIDs
    
        1. 1.3.6.1.4.1 (???)

        1. 1.3.6.1.2.1 (???)

```
