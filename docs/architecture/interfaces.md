## Principle: What is an 'INTERFACE'

    Requirements to exist:
        MAC Address

## Principle: No MAC == INTERFACE DOES NOT EXIST

    If we pull in data from a collector and there is no MAC
        We can store it in that local collector's datbaase
        but it is NOT propagated to the 'ONI_DB.INTERFACE' table
