## Collectors

ONI Collectors go out into the network and retrieve network information from network infrastructure in your local network.

## Configurators

ONI Configurators are services that go out into the network and update information on devices. For example, a Configurator can set the hostnames of Unifi Devices correctly based on Active Directory DNS, ensuring that when the Unifi collector retrieves the hostname, it is accurate.
